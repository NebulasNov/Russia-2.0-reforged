 news.103.d:0 "[195.GetName], birthplace of the Russian Revolution, has fallen to advancing German forces. \n\nSporadic fighting can still be heard from some suburbs, but a strange calm appears to have settled over the rest of the ruined city.\n\nEarlier today, columns of German soldiers marched past St. Isaac's Cathedral, whose great dome has been painted gray by [SOV.GetAdjective] engineers to avoid the attention of marauding Luftwaffe bombers. \nDespite their efforts, it is riddled with bullet holes and shrapnel impacts."

Moments after the Germans had occupied the city, thousands of mines planted by [SOV.GetAdjective] agents were apparently detonated in buildings along the Khreshchatyk main street, causing even more damage to the already ruined city.\n\nNow the invading forces look to the east."

According to unconfirmed reports, holdouts from the [SOV.GetAdjective] Army fighting together with partisans have retreated into sewers and basements to continue their struggle. \n\nNo significant organized resistance is believed to remain, however."

 news.106.d:0 "At dawn today, German panzers smashed through hastily erected barriers on the streets of [219.GetName] and half-tracks were seen unloading Panzergrenadiers on Red Square. \nThick, billowing smoke from the many fires raging in the suburbs could be seen rising into the air as German infantry stormed the Kremlin. Grenades and flamethrowers were reportedly needed to fight stubborn [SOV.GetAdjective] holdouts intent on defending every inch of the complex. The [SOV.GetAdjective] capital is now in German hands, but has been left a burning ruin. \n\nUnconfirmed reports indicate Lenin's embalmed corpse was safely evacuated east."

 news.122.d:0 "[408.GetName], the largest city in the Russian Far East and home of the [SOV.GetAdjective] Pacific Fleet, has been stormed by Japanese troops. Its strategic position at the far end of the Trans-Siberian Railway makes its loss all the more detrimental to the [SOV.GetAdjective] war effort in Asia.\n\nMany of the city's inhabitants still remember the Japanese occupation that lasted for several years during the Russian Civil War. This time, some fear they may never leave."
 news.136.d:0 "After a series of pitched battles, Allied forces have occupied [219.GetName], capital of [SOV.GetNameDef]. The city has suffered extensive damage, and fires are still raging on both sides of the Moskva river. Despite heavy bombing the Kremlin is reasonably intact, and it has been chosen as the location for the headquarters of the Allied Occupation Administration.\n\nWith the loss of [219.GetName], the [SOV.GetAdjective] war effort has suffered an enormous blow. Although most of the government is believed to have evacuated the city well in advance of its fall, military experts claim that a complete [SOV.GetAdjective] collapse may not be far away."
 news.138.d:0 "Unlike 1920, there was no 'Miracle at the Vistula' when [SOV.GetAdjective] armies recently approached Warsaw. Polish resistance in the city has largely collapsed, and the [SOV.GetAdjective] flag can be seen raised over most government buildings.\n\nAre we witnessing the end of the Polish nation, or will their forces somehow manage to rebound and retake their capital? Most experts consider this scenario unlikely."

 news.139.t:0 "The Liberation of Warsaw"
 news.139.d:0 "The devastated city of Warsaw has fallen to advancing [SOV.GetAdjective] armies, after the last German defenders retreated from its burning suburbs. Much of the city lies in ruins after previous battles, and local resistance members hurriedly emerged from the rubble to greet their liberators.\n\nWith Warsaw under [SOV.GetAdjective] control, the strategic situation for Germany in Eastern Europe may soon deteriorate further. Experts are doubtful that they will be able to mount a counterattack to retake the city, but the harried local population does not seem quite as convinced."
 news.139.a:0 "Is this the beginning of the end...?"
 news.140.d:0 "A [SOV.GetAdjective] communique has announced the capitulation of all German forces in Berlin. After encircling the city, the Russians stormed it from several different directions, with the German defenders resisting furiously every step of the way.\n\n[SOV.GetAdjective] troops finally fought their way across the Moltke Bridge and into the Reichstag building, fighting room by room until they reached the roof where the [SOV.GetAdjective] flag was raised over the city. The Battle of Berlin is over."

 news.140.b:0 "The Germans are no more!"
 news.141.d:0 "Rome, the 'Eternal City,' has fallen to the advancing [SOV.GetAdjective] spearheads. As Italian forces fell back, Russian troops fanned out into the city and dealt with the few remaining pockets of resistance. Most historical landmarks appear to have suffered little damage, although there are conflicting reports that the Pantheon was raked by machine gun fire.\n\nSo far [SOV.GetNameDef] appears to be respecting the neutrality of the Holy See, but their forces have positioned themselves in a ring around Vatican City - a gesture that must surely make His Holiness nervous."
 news.142.d:0 "The inexorable advance of the [SOV.GetAdjective] Army continues, and reports are now coming in that the French capital has fallen.\n\n[SOV.GetNameDefCap] announced to the Parisians that no arms would be done to any of them, shall they stay home and avoid disturbing the advancing [SOV.GetAdjective] forces against the few remaining troops of the Armée de Terre."
 news.143.d:0 "In the latest Order of the Day broadcast from Moscow, the capture of Paris from German forces was announced. Many of the city's defenders reportedly drowned in the Seine after a heavy [SOV.GetAdjective] artillery barrage demolished several of the bridges crossing the river.\n\nThe Eiffel Tower was toppled after a massive explosion at its base, although it remains unclear which side was responsible. [SOV.GetAdjective] forces are now holding a victory parade on the Champs-Élysées while weary Parisians look on, wondering if they have only traded one occupier for another."

 news.144.d:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] continues its glorious advance, with [SOV.GetAdjective] forces recently having completed the capture of London. A parade was quickly organized by the [SOV.GetAdjective] Army, even before the last pockets of resistance in the city had been fully dealt with.\n\n[SOV.GetAdjective] sympathizers have been quick to turn in the names of known anti-[SOV.GetRulingIdeology] to the [SOV.GetAdjective] military authorities, and a People's Court has convened at Trafalgar Square to punish the worst offenders."
 news.145.d:0 "Fires continue to rage in central London, but it is believed that most of the city's German occupiers have either fallen in battle or been captured by the advancing [SOV.GetAdjective] forces. Crowds have emerged on the streets to cheer the Russians on as they move to deal with the last stubborn holdouts.\n\nCollaborators have been dealt with harshly, and [SOV.GetNameDef] have organized an interim council to administrate the liberated city until further notice."
 news.145.a:0 "A significant development."
 news.146.d:0 "[SOV.GetAdjective] forces have converged on Tokyo, and heavy fighting has been reported throughout the city. Most of the city is under [SOV.GetAdjective] control now, with the exception of the eastern suburbs where massive fires are still raging.\n\nWhen the fighting shifted towards the Imperial Palace, members of the Imperial Guard reportedly launched bayonet charges against the approaching [SOV.GetAdjective] troops. The palace was eventually stormed by a detachment of VDV paratroopers, who had to fight their way through the compound room by room. No prisoners were taken, but it is believed that the Emperor was safely evacuated before the city fell."
 news.147.d:0 "[195.GetName], the former capital of the Russian Empire, has been occupied by Finnish forces. With a population of over three million, the city has nearly as many inhabitants as all of Finland, but this fact has evidently not deterred the Finnish attackers.\n\nThere is some debate as to whether the city should be integrated into Greater Finland, since Ingrian Finns make up a considerable minority in the regions outside the city. This, of course, assumes that the [SOV.GetAdjective] Army is unable to retake the city in a counteroffensive."

 news.153.d:0 "The non-aggression pact between Germany and [SOV.GetNameDef], a surprising development to begin with, has now less surprisingly fallen apart. Germany has attacked, breaking the pact and returned to once again openly speaking of [SOV.GetNameDef] as a menace that must be faced for their visions of the future to become reality.\n\n[SOV.GetAdjective] leadership is less than pleased, but perhaps less shocked by the betrayal than disappointed that they didn't seize the opportunity first."

This solidarity with workers around the world was a key element in [From.GetLeader]'s speech today when the [From.GetFactionName] was announced.\n\nGoing beyond a political International, this is an alliance that binds the countries militarily, with both regimes promising to aid each other against outside threats.
