The internal power struggles that followed have shifted our focus, and purging the Party ranks themselves has been given more emphasis since Trotsky's exile. Stalin has made himself an icon but at the cost of making many real enemies and innumerable imaginary ones.\n\nHaving seen the worst of internal power struggles, the General Secretary is prone to act on the slightest suspicion. Being purged from the Party means imprisonment or death. Dark times lie ahead for those who show disloyalty - or just a bit too much loyalty to seem credible."

 soviets.25.t:0 "Trial of the Anti-Soviet Trotskyist Center"
 soviets.25.d:0 "Despite Leon Trotsky being forced into exile, Joseph Stalin fears that he has secret supporters within the party. A series of rapid arrests and brutal interrogations have yielded confessions and testimonies conveniently pointing to some of Stalin's rivals. However, the more questions are asked and the deeper the secret police delves into letters and journals, the more people are implicated, if indirectly.\n\nParty members are beginning to believe that Stalin's absolute power and the death of his wife have isolated him to the point where he perceives anyone as a threat but isn't that exactly what a traitor would say?"

 soviets.26.t:0 "Secret Trial of the Generals"
 soviets.26.d:0 "The Red Army has always been home to subversive elements, ever since Trotsky himself was Commissar of War. Documents acquired by the NKVD have implicated several high-ranking officers as not only traitors, but spies. Mikhail Tukhachevsky is among the most prominent of the suspects, and one Stalin is keen to rid the army of. Meanwhile, the navy's frequent contact with foreigners has led to many of them being arrested as well.\n\nAlthough there are documents from our enemies proving their guilt, there is no telling if they fabricated them, or if they were given false information by those who wanted this purge in motion to begin with."
 soviets.26.a:0 "Tukhachevsky must be tried in secret and executed immediately."

 soviets.27.d:0 "After several rounds of arrests and trials, the Great Purge has weaved a narrative that led up to this trial. Among the accused are not only old leaders like Nikolai Bukharin, but a number of diplomats, politicians, military officials and even many high-ranking NKVD officers. The charges are also more extensive than previously, including decade-old plots to murder Soviet leaders and sell the Union to its enemies.\n\nThe fact that the NKVD themselves are now among the targets of the purge has in a sense brought the proceedings in full circle. Threats and beatings have led to many confessing to all charges, even the most outlandish ones. The leading defendants face execution."

 soviets.28.d:0 "After removing most political opponents, we are now faced a much bigger problem : outside politics. Our country may be stabilized, but we have to choose a way with foreign affairs, such as choosing our future allies and enemies. Molotov seems pretty inexperienced and interested in an alliance with [GER.GetNameDef]. Against him, Maisky, who kept warning the democratic nations against the rise of fascism in Europe, pleading for an alliance. Maisky has been pretty unsuccessful at convincing the capitalist nations, \"They do not seem to realize how big of a threat [GER.GetLeader] is, but I am sure they will soon enough.\" is what he said. Should we keep on trusting him, or make a different approach by choosing Molotov?"

 soviets.283.d:0 "Following our positive answer, Anastasy departed from [366.GetName] a few days ago and arrived in [ROOT.Capital.GetName] today. His arrival was welcomed by many supporters from our own ranks, seeking in him a fascist union to bring Russia to greatness."
 soviets.283.a:0 "Welcome back!"
 soviets.284.t:0 "The Place of Anastasy"
 soviets.284.d:0 "Despite his recent arrival, we still didn't give him a precise place in our government. Many recognize his tactics as being ingenious and thus making him a good candidate for head of the war cabinet. Others see him as a perfect figure for ruling the country... But a few have issued warnings and contestation towards him."
 soviets.284.a:0 "Appoint him as a minister for now."
 soviets.284.b:0 "Offer him what he deserves. A ruling with Konstantin."
 soviets.285.t:0 "Dinner in the Kremlin"
 soviets.285.d:0 "An official dinner between Konstantin, Anastasy, and other ministers has been planned accordingly to the nomination of Anastasy. They will discuss the term of their new alliance as well as the future of the country in general. The German question is something that has been brought up a lot recently and Konstantin promised to give a precise answer during this dinner. Many fear the close relations Anastasy has shown towards the German government."
 soviets.285.a:0 "I'll take some popcorn please."
 soviets.286.t:0 "Konstantin's Last Night?"
 soviets.286.d:0 "The dinner at the Kremlin happened as planned, before Konstantin suddenly fell down his chair, uncouncious. The local guards immediately called his private doctors, which describe his state as critical. Him and a few other members were poisonned, most likely from the food they ate. Weirdly enough, Anastasy and his few supporters are all doing fine."
 soviets.286.a:0 "Let's hope... He'll recover?"
 soviets.287.t:0 "Konstantin Dies"
 soviets.287.d:0 "It was his last breath. Konstantin died this morning, after a few days under intense medicine effort. Anastasy denounced his death as \"tragic\", without giving too much information on what really happened. Rumors say Anastasy did not get poisoned for a reason... He is the one who ordered the poison. Sadly, the murderer will never be found. The cookers were sentenced to death and the affair closed."
 soviets.287.a:0 "Order triumphed."
 soviets.288.t:0 "Konstantin Survives"
 soviets.288.d:0 "Konstantin survived after many days unconscious. His first action was to ask for a removal of Anastasy from the government, claiming that he is the one who tried to kill him. Many in the Kremlin were taken into custody, a direct order from Konstantin, whose paranoia has suddenly become uncontrollable. Reminds you of someone, eh?\n\nSadly for Konstantin, Anastasy had envisaged this possibility and is fully prepared to counter-attack."
 soviets.288.a:0 "It's too late... Anastasy is already proclaiming his new government. Konstantin is sentenced to death for high treason."
 soviets.288.b:0 "Konstantin's guard manages to stop Anastasy and arrest him for good."
 soviets.289.t:0 "Konstantin Assassinated!"
 soviets.289.d:0 "To no one's surprise, the sit offered to Anastasy was way too dangerous. In a matter of weeks, Anastasy gathered much support from the army. Last afternoon, he took a gun and shot Konstantin during a meeting. Many of his supporters present during this meeting simply laughed, while the few unawares were arrested and taken to custody for the \"Murder of Konstantin Rodzaevsky\". Believing it or not does not matter, as any who publically denounces Anastasy of responsible for the murder has been promised a journey to Siberia."
 soviets.289.a:0 "Order triumphed."
 soviets.290.t:0 "The Second Letter"
 soviets.290.d:0 "Anastasy Vonsyatsky agreed to recognize the current fascist party as the legitimate ruling party of Russia. He did not express any need to be in the government for now, and simply wants to come back to the Motherland. Many of his supporters are pressuring us to bring him back, while a few others stand firm on opposing his return."
 soviets.290.a:0 "The pressure is too great. We'll let him come back."
 soviets.290.b:0 "Allow his return, he will be kept under heavy surveillance."
 soviets.291.t:0 "The Few Warnings"
 soviets.291.d:0 "Among the ones who support us, few have issued warnings concerning Anastasy. They greatly believe in his intention to take over our current position. While letting him return freely considerably appeased tensions, the danger keeps growing. We have to be careful."
 soviets.291.a:0 "They are right. Arrest Anastasy, his methods are not welcomed here."
 soviets.291.b:0 "Ignore them."
 soviets.292.t:0 "Anastasy's Proposal"
 soviets.292.d:0 "Anastasy stayed rather calm since his return. He, however, turned towards us with a rather big smile, hoping for friendly relations with his formed fascist party and a possible coalition in the future. While he will not hold any important position if we accept, he might try to organize something behind our back. Refusing could severely anger his supporters."
 soviets.292.a:0 "Seems reasonable. Accept his proposal."
 soviets.292.b:0 "He's clearly trying to play with us."
 soviets.293.t:0 "The Great Betrayal"
 soviets.293.d:0 "Konstantin was found dead this morning! His corpse was found laying on his desktop as he was writing a letter. Despite the bloody mess, we can read some of it \"Anastasy cannot be trusted...\". The murder was probably done in a hurry. Despite this clear evidence of Anastasy being responsible for Konstantin's death, it's already too late. This betrayal was feared by many and has now taken place, meaning Anastasy now has full control of both fascist parties."
 soviets.293.a:0 "Order triumphed."
 soviets.294.t:0 "Anastasy Opposes Konstantin"
 soviets.294.d:0 "With the many denunciations against him and the current hunt to arrest him, Anastasy decided to officially show up with his supporters and a good part of the army, menacing to assault the Kremlin at any moment. He claims that Konstantin is a heartless dictator who betrayed him as soon as he could, but also state that his supporters are far more numerous than our current guard in [ROOT.Capital.GetName]. Such accusations cannot be tolerated!"
 soviets.294.a:0 "Denounce Anastasy as enemy of the nation."
 soviets.294.b:0 "We'll get ride of him soon enough."
 soviets.295.t:0 "Anastasy Arrested"
 soviets.295.d:0 "His words were lies from the beginning. His supporters were partially inactive, mostly because way too dispersed all over the country. Our guard had no trouble arresting him once they finally found his hideout. He will be taken to custody without judgment, as asked by Konstantin."
 soviets.295.a:0 "The Law triumphed."
 soviets.296.t:0 "Assassination of Konstantin"
 soviets.296.d:0 "Despite all the troops mobilized to stop him, he still somehow managed to do it. Anastasy assassinated Konstantin, helped by a few of his supporters, and immediately took power, arresting almost everyone in the current government. Some say that infiltrated members were already established around Konstantin way before Anastasy's return."
 soviets.296.a:0 "Order triumphed."
 soviets.297.t:0 "Anastasy Deported"
 soviets.297.d:0 "Anastasy was arrested early this morning, following the advice of many. His judgment was made quick and clear : exiled to Siberia for life. He will be getting a small house heavily guarded, and his supporters considered \"too dangerous\", put to prison. This will certainly change him from the sun in Florida."
 soviets.297.a:0 "The Law triumphed."
 soviets.298.t:0 "The Prepared Return of Anastasy"
 soviets.298.d:0 "Our announcement on the refusal of Anastasy's return did not stay unnoticed. Many decided to join his cause and believe his words, aiming in making Konstantin fall. We have to be prepared for anything, as reports show that he is willing to take a plane directly to [ROOT.Capital.GetName] and gather his supporters for a coup. What should we do?"
 soviets.298.a:0 "We'll pay the price. Sabotage his plane."
 soviets.298.b:0 "Even if he gets here, he won't do anything."
 soviets.299.t:0 "Anastasy Returns"
 soviets.299.d:0 "Anastasy returned, helped by many of his supporters directly in Russia. We might not know where he exactly is, but finding him will only take a few days, his supporters being too noisy to go unnoticed. We still have to be careful though, he might be planning something to take us down in one go."
 soviets.299.a:0 "Let him be, for now."
 soviets.299.b:0 "Greet him with force."
 soviets.300.t:0 "Anastasy Dies"
 soviets.300.d:0 "Our sabotage succeded! Anastasy's plane took off late in the night and was quickly noticed by one of our radars. One of the wings exploded shortly before reaching Siberia, sealing Anastasy's fate at the bottom of the cold Siberian sea. While the rumor is propagating about his death, no official discourse shall be given about it."
 soviets.300.a:0 "The Law triumphed."
 soviets.301.t:0 "Anastasy Arrested"
 soviets.301.d:0 "The armed forces sent to arrest Anastasy did their job successfully. Anastasy was taken by surprise when his hideout was suddenly shot at by elite units from the army. His arrestation quickly followed."
 soviets.301.a:0 "The Law triumphed."
 soviets.302.t:0 "A Great Menace"
 soviets.302.d:0 "Our forces are not doing as good as we though at tracking people. Anastasy, known as the Great Menace among the government, is hiding somewhere, preparing for a coup. It was to no one's surprise, his plan all along. We might be under attack at any moment and have to stay vigilant. The moment he'll strike, we'll counter-attack and capture him!"
 soviets.302.a:0 "We're prepared."
 soviets.303.t:0 "Anastasy's Coup"
 soviets.303.d:0 "The worst happened. His coup succeeded. Despite all the preparations from Konstantin's guard, Anastasy had the upper hand since the start, many officers rallied to him and worked against Konstantin from the inside. Following the bloody massacre of the current government, Anastasy took power and declared the establishment of the true Russian fascism."
 soviets.303.a:0 "Order triumphed."
 soviets.304.t:0 "The Failed Coup"
 soviets.304.d:0 "Our intuitions were confirmed, our guard, established. He did not stand a chance. Anastasy showed up during an official meeting between fascist supporters, hoping for a quick victory over us. His weakly armed supporters quickly ran off, seeing our superiority. The guard went as far as using 50 bombers, mostly to intimidate the remaining soldiers. Anastasy was captured soon after."
 soviets.304.a:0 "The Law triumphed."
 soviets.305.t:0 "The Arrestation of Anastasy Vonsyatsky"
 soviets.305.d:0 "[SOV.GetNameDefCap] is facing a lot of issues following the establishment of Konstantin's party as head of the government. Most noticeably, Anastasy Vonsyatsky, a Russian supporting his own fascism, exiled in [366.GetName]. Many of his supporters are actively protesting, hoping for his return to [SOV.GetNameDef]. Thus, Konstantin contacted us, asking for his immediate arrestation, warning about the danger he represents for both of our countries. An arrestation without any reason might rise suspicion though, shall we make too much noise."

 soviets.308.t:0 "Anastasy Intercepted"
 soviets.308.d:0 "Our head of army suggested a blockade on many ports and airports which could see the arrival of Anastasy. He was right. A little before midnight, Anastasy was intercepted as he landed in an airport, close to [217.GetName]. His arrestation from there was a simple formality. The few supporters waiting for him have also been placed under surveillance, followed by a journey in custody."

Yesterday morning, a group of armed militias entered the prison of [ROOT.Capital.GetName], not showing any intention to shoot, but asking for Anastasy's location...\n\nHe was liberated, by what we believe to be an extremist group supporting his ideology. After Anastasy got out, Alexander Rodzyanko was quick to respond with a cavalry charge, taking him over by speed. The armed militias feared they wouldn't make it out in time, and mined the place. What followed was 30 minutes of pure hell, with all the armed militias, and Anastasy, being killed... Two men from Alexander's army have been reported dead. On the militias' corpses, German and Japanese guns were found, which surprised Alexander.

The [FROM.GetAdjective] government finally surrendered the country, understanding that their defeat was inevitable as Communist support within the country was way out of hand.

 POLITICS_PAVEL_MILYUKOV_DESC:0 "Pavel Nikolayevich Milyukov is a Russian historian and liberal politician. Milyukov was the founder, leader, and the most prominent member of the Constitutional Democratic party (known as the Kadets). In the Russian Provisional Government, he served as Foreign Minister, working to prevent Russia's exit from the First World War. On 26 October 1917, the party's newspapers were shut down by the new Soviet regime. On 25 November 1917 Milyukov was elected in the Russian Constituent Assembly, the first truly free election in Russian history. On 28 November the party was banned by the Soviet regime and went underground. Milyukov moved from Petrograd to the Don Host Oblast. There he became a member of the Don civil council. He advised Mikhail Alekseyev of the Volunteer Army. Milyukov and Struve defended a Great Russia as firmly as the most reactionary monarchist. In May 1918 he went to Kiev, where he negotiated with the German high command to act together against the Bolsheviks. For many members of the Cadet Party, this went too far: Milyukov was forced to resign the presidency of the KDP Central Committee. Milyukov went to Turkey and from there to Western Europe, to get support from the allies of the White movement, involved in the Russian Civil War. He continued his exile in France before being called back by the Federation to lead the country."
 POLITICS_ALEXANDER_KERENSKY_DESC:0 "Alexander Fyodorovich Kerensky is a Russian lawyer and revolutionary who was a key political figure in the Russian Revolution of 1917. After the February Revolution of 1917, he joined the newly formed Russian Provisional Government, first as Minister of Justice, then as Minister of War, and after July as the government's second Minister-Chairman. A leader of the moderate-socialist Trudovik faction of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, he was also vice-chairman of the powerful Petrograd Soviet. On 7 November, his government was overthrown by the Lenin-led Bolsheviks in the October Revolution. He then went to exile in Paris where he remained until the recent political chaos in Russia, where he came back to lead the Federation."
 POLITICS_JOSEPH_STALIN_DESC:0 "Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin is a Georgian revolutionary and Soviet politician. Despite initially governing the Soviet Union as part of a collective leadership, he eventually consolidated power to become the country's de facto dictator by the 1930s, industrializing the country with harsh methods. A communist ideologically committed to the Leninist interpretation of Marxism, Stalin formalized these ideas as Marxism–Leninism, while his own policies are known as Stalinism. Will he bring the Soviet Union to greatness, or will his paranoia finally take him down? His future lays ahead with the Union."
 POLITICS_LEON_TROTSKY_DESC:0 "Leon Trotsky is a Soviet revolutionary, Marxist theorist and politician whose particular strain of Marxist thought is known as Trotskyism. Trotsky joined the Bolshevik Party a few weeks before the October Revolution, thus immediately becoming a leader within the party, and was one of the leaders of the October Revolution. Once in government, Trotsky initially held the post of the Commissar for Foreign Affairs and was involved in the Brest-Litovsk negotiations with Germany as Russia pulled out of World War One. After the rise of Joseph Stalin, Trotsky was removed from his positions and eventually expelled from the Soviet Union in February 1929. He then went to exile in many countries such as Turkey, France and Norway where he remained and kept developing the Trotskyist ideas before coming back to the Soviet Union after the defeat of Joseph Stalin."
 POLITICS_PAVEL_BERMONDT_DESC:0 "Pavel Bermondt-Avalov is an Ussuri Cossack and warlord. He is best known as the commander of the West Russian Volunteer Army which was active in present-day Latvia and Lithuania in the aftermath of World War I. He was appointed to lead the German-established Western Russian army (subsequently frequently known after his name as "the Bermontians") which was meant to go to fight the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War, but, believing that communists would be defeated without his help, Pavel Bermondt-Avalov decided to strike against the newly independent nations of Lithuania and Latvia instead. His \"Special Russians Corps\" supposedly numbered about 50,000 men. He was one of the few anti-communist generals who openly promoted monarchist ideals. After the Russian defeat in the civil war, Pavel Bermondt-Avalov emigrated to Western Europe, where he published a book of memoirs. He lived in Germany from 1921 and was involved in right-wing and fascist movements. Strongly supportive of National Socialism, he established his own movement, the Russian National Socialist Movement. He immediately joined the fight against the Soviet Union once the Second Civil War broke out, rallying with Denikin. After Andrey took power, he was the number one target for the transfer of power. Everyone believes in him to bring Russia to greatness."
 POLITICS_ANDREY_VLASOV_DESC:0 "Born in Lomakino, Nizhny Novgorod Governorate, Russian Empire, Vlasov was originally a student at a Russian Orthodox seminary. He quit the study of divinity after the Russian Revolution, briefly studying agricultural sciences instead, and in 1919 joined the Red Army fighting in the southern theatre in Ukraine, the Caucasus, and the Crimea. He distinguished himself as an officer and gradually rose through the ranks of the Red Army. Vlasov joined the Communist Party in 1930. Sent to China, he acted as a military adviser to Chiang Kai-shek. Despite being a loyal Russian Red Army general, Stalin had suspicions about him and his name was high on Stalin's purge list. After the second Civil War started, he first hesitated to pick a side but then decided to join the White Army, mostly to avoid being killed by Stalin's paranoia, thinking he was a double agent working for the White Guard. After the victory, Denikin left his place of leader and designed Andrey as his successor for the military Junta, opposing the restoration of the Tsar on the way. He now rules over Russia with direct ties to the army."
 POLITICS_ANASTASY_VONSYATSKY_DESC:0 "Anastasy Andreyevich Vonsyatsky, better known in the United States as Anastase Andreivitch Vonsiatsky, was a Russian anti-Bolshevik émigré and fascist leader based in the United States from the 1920s. He became a naturalized American citizen while leading a splinter far-right organization, the Russian National Revolutionary Labor and Workers Peasant Party of Fascists. The headquarters of the RFO was based in Putnam, Connecticut. Once the Second Civil War broke out, he showed support to the White Guard but did not directly intervene. Once Konstantin managed to take over the country, he quickly realized his chance and sent a letter, hoping for renewing of the ties between their two Fascist party. He then backstabbed Konstantin and took over Russia. He describes his Fascism as different from any other, and his methods are somewhat showing great results."
 POLITICS_KONSTANTIN_RODZAEVSKY_DESC:0 "Konstantin Vladimirovich Rodzaevsky is the leader of the Russian Fascist Party, which he led in exile from Manchuria. Rodzaevsky was also the chief editor of the RFP paper Nash Put'. After the defeat of anti-communist forces in the Russian Civil War, he and his followers fled to Japanese-controlled China. Rodzaevsky had around 12,000 followers in Manchukuo. During the 2,600th anniversary of the founding of the Empire of Japan, Rodzaevsky, with a select group of people, paid his respects to Emperor Hirohito at the official celebration in the region. Once the Second Russian Civil War broke out, he did not pick a side but seeing the quick defeats of the Soviet army, he started organizing Fascist meetings in Siberia, directly under his commends from Manchuria. He influenced a major part of the army, and after the victory, it was only a matter of time before the army came to the Manchurian border and bring him back to Russia. Denikin did not approve of his takeover and resigned shortly after. He is, with no doubt, the person every Russian puts their fate in. His function as a lawyer influences his decisions heavily, and he makes respecting the laws a priority in Russia."
 POLITICS_VASILY_STALIN_DESC:0 "Vasily Iosifovich Stalin is the son of Joseph Stalin by his second wife, Nadezhda Alliluyeva. Vasily's mother killed herself when he was 11 years old, so he was mainly raised by his father, who did not care for his son much. He prepared his coup against his own father as soon as Moscow was threatened, knowing that nobody was designed to take over the Soviet Union once Stalin gone. He joined the air force a bit earlier once the war broke out, and proved to be a good pilot but with bad tactics and behaviors. Nonetheless, he promised to bring peace and success in the Soviet Union, and not fear and hatred like his father did."
 POLITICS_NIKITA_KHRUSHCHEV_DESC:0 "Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev is a Soviet politician. Khrushchev was born in 1894 in the village of Kalinovka, in western Russia, close to the present-day border between Russia and Ukraine. He was employed as a metalworker during his youth, and he was a political commissar during the Russian Civil War. With the help of Lazar Kaganovich, he worked his way up the Soviet hierarchy. He supported Joseph Stalin's purges and approved thousands of arrests. In 1938, Stalin sent him to govern the Ukrainian SSR, and he continued the purges there. After Stalin's death, he was the one to have the most knowledge and the one Stalin could trust, thus he succeeded in leading the Soviet Union. He did ease the tensions and purges quite a bit by enabling a global De-Stalinization in the country, erasing the tyrant's mistakes from the country."
